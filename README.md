# Typing-Buddy
Typing Buddy is a hardware and software integration designed to allow a feline companion to interface with a computer system, enabling them to type in synchronization with the user. This project utilizes an Arduino-based mechanical rig and a background executable to bridge the gap between physical movement and digital input.
